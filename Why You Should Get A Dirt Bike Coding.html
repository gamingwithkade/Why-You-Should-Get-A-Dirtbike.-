            <h1 style="color:white;">Why You Should Get A Dirt Bike</h1>
            <br>
            <p style="color:white;">First of all Contrary to what some people may believe, riding a dirt bike is a mighty fine workout. Even a half hour ride on the track or trail can leave you feeling sore the next day. My favorite part about the physical aspect of riding a dirt bike is that in order to ride properly you have to get a full body workout whether you expect it or not. Muscles that you forgot you even have end up getting utilized, your core is strengthened, and the end result is a well rounded body. In addition to muscular improvements from riding your heart rate is elevated during the ride and your cardiovascular system gets a good workout as well. </p>

            <h1 style="color:white">It Improves Your Balance.</h1>
            <br>
            <p style="color:white">Using your leg muscles while riding will help keep you balanced as you accelerate up and down hills and over jumps. As your body braces against bumps, it will tighten its various muscles to keep in balance.</p>

            <h1 style="color:white">Good Posture</h1>
            <br>
            <p style="color:white">Posture really does make a difference in riding ability, and once riders realize that, they want to maintain the best posture possible. This choice, while made simply to improve performance on the bike, can help become a healthy habit off of the bike too.</p>

            <br>
            <p style="color:white">Most of the worlds best MotoGP riders started on dirt bikes!  Dirt biking teaches you many new riding techniques that can be transferred onto the road.  Riding on sand, wet clay, rocks, and gnarly trails on a forest trails will not only increase your awareness of the surroundings but you will learn the feel of the bike better and vastly improve the control you have and these new skills will transfer onto the street.  When was the last time you seized up going around a bend and heading into a patch of sand or gravel?
